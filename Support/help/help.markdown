# Introduction

Cappuccino <a href="http://cappuccino.org">cappuccino.org</a> is an open source framework that makes it easy to build desktop-caliber applications that run in a web browser.

# Commands

## Run
<button>&#x2318;R&nbsp;</button>
Run the current cappuccino web application in TextMate's HTML output window.

If you are inside of an Objective-J file (file extension .j) this command will look for a file `index.html` starting at the current folder and upwards within the file hierarchy or if you are working with a project it will look for it at the project's root path.

If the start HTML site differs you can set the shell variable `TM_OBJJ_MASTER_FILE` within a project.
